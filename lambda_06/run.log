GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2018.1
Executable:   /usr/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr
Working dir:  /mnt/c/Users/garci/Desktop/gromacs-free-energy-tutorial/lambda_06
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nt 4


Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.2#
Compiled SIMD: SSE2, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
